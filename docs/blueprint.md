## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep green (#336633), referencing nature and ecological health.
- Background color: A desaturated, light green (#E0E5D8), to ensure sufficient contrast while suggesting nature. It matches the 'Arctic' gradient fetched from React Bits.
- Accent color: A brighter, slightly blue-ish green (#669966) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif that will give an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel to titles and shorter texts.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif selected for readability and clarity. 'PT Sans' will work in combination with the elegant titles created with the font Playfair.
- Use simple, nature-inspired icons, e.g., a tree for tree detection or a leaf for the GreenScore, to make the single-page site experience more inviting and enjoyable.
- Utilize two distinct backgrounds fetched from React Bits for the landing page and the upload section, visually dividing the page into clear sections.
